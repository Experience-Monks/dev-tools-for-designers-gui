installing the development tools necessary to run many projects easy for designers.

After the gui launches, you have the option to install dev depencies like node and sublime etc.
If you don't have the dev tools, install them first. The install process may take awhile. You will be notified when it is completed.

Afterwards, you can enter your github credentials, select the repo you want, download it
and automatically install the depencies you need to run it.
