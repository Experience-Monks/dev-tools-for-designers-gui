# dev-tools-gui
Creating dev-tools-for-designers and git management gui using electron (in progress). So You can install 
node, npm, github, git-lfs and sublime in one click as well as other features and can clone your 
repositories and install the node dependencies through the github feature. Eventually will be
packaged as an electron application that will support linux, OSX and maybe windows.

currently needs 'electron-prebuilt' to install 

```
npm i --save
```
then
```
npm i -g electron-prebuilt
```

and run ``` electron . ``` from the directory to launch. Won't be necessary when 
packaged as an electron app.
